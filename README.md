# Johto Expansion Pack
A mod for Pokemon Showdown, specifically the Dragon Heaven server. This mod adds scrapped Pokemon, regional formes, and cross-gen evolutions to Generation 2, with the intention of making the metagame more diverse without actually changing the metagame much. It is intended to be compatible with any competitive Generation 2 format.

It is a sequel to the Kanto Expansion Pak.

A full spreadsheet detailing every new addition can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jAei-gOvkJ6747XFnBw3AadNLKyeHbYJPKGPizyLJFY/edit#gid=0).
